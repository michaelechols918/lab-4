    <h1>Michael Echols:</h1>
      <p>About Me: I am Originally from Atlanta but I've always felt like I have
         been apart of the PSNW since birth. I have a black belt in Kung Fu and
         Street Fighter. I have a green thumb and a passion for photography as
         well. You could find me in a bookstore reading Kafka, or sipping
         Kombucha while making groovy beats on Abelton.<p>
      <p>Education: I majored in Culinary Arts and Restaurant Management, but
         I have become inspired to learn and master Web Design and App
         Development at Code Fellows.</p>
      <p>Job Experience: I have never had Web Developer Experience in the work
         place, but I did graduate from Code Fellows and mastered App
         Development with Ruby and Python.</p>
      <p>Goals:I want to bring my love for food to the internet world and create
         wonderful websites and apps to help out everyone's inner "Foodie" eat,
         learn, and love the arts of cooking.</p>
